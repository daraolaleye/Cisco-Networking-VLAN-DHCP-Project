# Cisco-Networking-VLAN-DHCP-Project
A Cisco Packet Tracer project that simulates a small enterprise network using VLANs and DHCP. The network separates devices into different VLANs, uses inter-VLAN routing for communication, and dynamically assigns IP addresses to hosts. This project was completed as part of my university networking coursework.
